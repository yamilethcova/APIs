# APIs - Yamileth Cova Challenge


In this deliverable, the purpose is to create a Python script to visualize weather data for over 500 cities using the citipy library and the OpenWeatherMap API. Scatter plots will showcase relationships between weather variables and latitude, such as Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. Linear regression will be computed for each relationship in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres to identify patterns.

In Part 2 (VacationPy), the geoViews library and Geoapify API will be used to create map visualizations. Points on the map will represent cities with sizes corresponding to humidity. Specific weather conditions will be filtered, and a new DataFrame will store city details. The Geoapify API will be used to find hotels near each city, and this information will be added to the map's hover message. The goal is to plan future vacations based on weather preferences.
